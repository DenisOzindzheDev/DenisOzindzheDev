# 🌫️ Into the Fog 🌫️

> **Head in the ceiling fan goes rolling**  
> *and missing like bullets slamming into deer skin*  
> **Glued my green eyes to your face, I'm blind**  
> *follow footsteps — a bleeding bloodline*  
> **Head in the ceiling fan goes rolling**  
> *and missing like bullets slamming into deer skin*
